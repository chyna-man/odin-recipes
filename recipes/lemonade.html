        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This classic lemonade recipe is the one my mom used to make for me when I was little. Ah, the taste of summer! It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. When using a clear pitcher, adding a few of the juiced lemon halves makes it look prettier.
